## Purpose

As someone who likes to use a mechanical keyboard for work, I found that most of them I like lack things like media controls. Eventually I found [FastScripts](https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/), which is a useful macOS utility that allows you to assign keyboard shortcuts to scripts, and so I have created this repository to publish the scripts that I use!

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.
2. Change directory to the root of the repo.
3. Run `add_folder.sh` to add the path to your checkout to FastScripts.
4. Assign keyboard shortcuts in FastScripts!
